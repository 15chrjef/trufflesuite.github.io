# Pet Shop Announcement

Here at Truffle we want to make Ethereum development accessible to developers of all stripes. To continue this effort, today we're releasing a new tutorial called [Pet Shop](/tutorials/pet-shop). In it, we'll create a pet adoption dapp for local pet shop owner Pete Scandlon.



This covers the entire local development process, start to finish. Here's a preview of what's covered:

*   Setting up The Development Environment
*   Creating a Truffle project
*   Writing and Testing a Smart Contract
*   Creating a UI to Interact with our Smart Contract

In the future we'll be building on this tutorial with others such as deploying to live testnets and additional, more advanced functionality. We hope you enjoy and thank everyone for your support!

Love it? Got stuck? We would love to hear from you. Don't hesitate to let us know about your experience with the Pet Shop tutorial at the [Truffle Gitter](http://gitter.im/Consensys/truffle).

Cheers!

-- Josh & the Truffle Team
